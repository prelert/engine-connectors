# A simple Anomaly Detective Engine connector to analyze a batch of data from a MySQL data store needs to:
# 1. Create an Engine API job
# 2. Query the data store
# 3. Stream data from the data store to the Engine API job

# For example, if time series data is stored in MySQL as follows:
# mysql> select time,value from time_series_points where time_series_id=4118 order by time;
# +---------------------+-------+
# | time                | value |
# +---------------------+-------+
# | 2010-02-10 06:21:00 |   409 |
# | 2010-02-10 06:21:30 |   409 |
# | 2010-02-10 06:22:00 |   409 |
# | 2010-02-10 06:22:30 |   409 |
# | 2010-02-10 06:23:00 |   409 |
# | 2010-02-10 06:23:30 |   409 |

# Note: IMPORTANT to order by time

# Set appropriately for your database
